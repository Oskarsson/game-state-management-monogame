# game-state-management-monogame
A direct port of the Game State Management sample for XNA 4 that used to be found
[here](http://xbox.create.msdn.com/en-US/education/catalog/sample/game_state_management) (but is now found [here](https://github.com/SimonDarksideJ/XNAGameStudio/wiki/Game-State-Management-(Mango,-C%23VB))), to Monogame.
It seems to have since been moved or deleted, but the license can now be found at the new link.

There is a very good [XNA Game Studio Archive repo](https://github.com/SimonDarksideJ/XNAGameStudio/wiki) that has a lot
of XNA Game Studio education content, including the original version of this repo, if you need more than this.

This is currently working while targeting netcoreapp3.1 and the version of Monogame that comes with the template found
[here](https://github.com/dotnet/templating/wiki/Available-templates-for-dotnet-new) - MonoGame (.NET Core)

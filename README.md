# game-state-management-monogame
A direct port of the Game State Management sample for XNA 4 found [here](http://xbox.create.msdn.com/en-US/education/catalog/sample/game_state_management) to Monogame

This is currently working while targeting netcoreapp2.1 and the version of Monogame that comes with the template found [here](https://github.com/dotnet/templating/wiki/Available-templates-for-dotnet-new)

The code could use a lot of cleanup, but at least it should work
